# Development
- Run app with `npm run dev`
- To run sanity locally, do `npm run start` (make sure Sanity is installed: `npm install -g @sanity/cli`)
  - Check out on localhost:3333
- To redeploy Sanity, do `npm run deploy`



# How this works
- `index.tsx` calls `getAllPosts()`, which gets both existing checked in posts (LegacyPost) and posts from Sanity (PostV2).
  - This calls into `cms.ts` CMSClient, which uses some complex query langauge nonsense to get the CMS posts

# Bugs
- Maybe V2 posts don't get the article inversion effect?

# Fun articles to write 
- How I did the header inversion effect
- Why I migrated from my own CMS to Sanity
  - It's fun to hand roll things, but ease of upload trumps all

### July 8
- [X] Render PostV2 lol
