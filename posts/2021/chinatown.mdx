One of my favorite SF weekend activities: wandering around Chinatown, camera in hand, soaking up the sights and sounds of the busy corner markets and men 
off-loading produce trucks.

It's chaotic, it's delightful, it's difficult as all hell to photograph because there's so much going on.

This batch is all Classic Chrome JPEG (tweaked in LR), shot on the classic Fujinon XF 35mm f/1.4.

  I need to write up a longer post about editing Classic Chrome at some point, but my approach towards editing these was to get them "somewhere between" Classic Chrome & Classic Negative film sims. Classic Chrome doesn't have the same harsh tonality as Classic Neg, so it's helpful to crunch the tone curve to increase the contrast. I warmed up the white balance because Classic Chrome often feels too cold, and used the tone curves to tint the shadows towards green and highlights towards cyan.

  As always, subtlety is king.
