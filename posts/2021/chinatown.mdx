One of my favorite weekend activities is to wander around San Francisco Chinatown, X-Pro3 in hand, basking in the sheer chaos of the street vendors and outdoor markets.  

Despite the noise and crowds, I find it strangely calming.  

Maybe it's the anonymity of the thing?

This batch is all Classic Chrome JPEG, shot on the glorious Fuji 35mm f1/4.

It had been a while since I'd gone out shooting, and like always, I felt extremely self conscious at first. I think it takes me about 45 minutes to get "warmed up" and lose that feeling. Music helps.

Once you're in the zone though, it becomes an extremely liberating experience - especially if you tend to feel self conscious often.
