One of my favorite SF weekend activities: wandering around Chinatown, X-Pro3 in hand, soaking up the sights and sounds of the busy corner markets and men 
off-loading produce trucks.

It's chaotic, it's delightful, it's hard as hell to photograph because there's so much going on.

This batch is all Classic Chrome JPEG, shot on the trusty Fuji 35mm f1.4.

I've been mostly shooting Classic Neg since I got this camera - it was interesting to come back to Classic Chrome.

I think I prefer how Classic Chrome handles blues/skies and the overall more naturalistic feel of the colors, while I enjoy the harsh tonality of Classic Negative. 

This is why Mr Adobe invented Lightroom, I suppose.
