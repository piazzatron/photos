My dad was recently vaccinated, so the job of picking up dinner when I visit now falls to him. Here he picks up takeout (and supports the pandemic economy) at one of the old neighborhood haunts. 

I shot this on the [Pergear 35mm f/1.6](https://www.amazon.com/PERGEAR-Compatible-Fujifilm-XF-Mount-Cameras/dp/B085TCWPYS), which I first saw on [Alik Griffin's lovely blog](https://alikgriffin.com/2020-mochitsuki-photos-some-lens-discussion/). This lens costs a cool $70 and basically rocks, surprisingly holding together wide open. Small manual focus lenses feel so at home on the X-Pro line - something tells me my XF 35mm f/1.4 will be gathering dust for a while.

I also picked up the [7Artisans 35mm f/1.2](https://www.amazon.com/7artisans-35mm-F1-2-Compact-Mirrorless/dp/B07DB4Z6Q7) recently, and I'll be posting shots from that one too. I'm not sure which of these two lenses I'll be using more in the future. The 1.2 is fun but has such crazy IQ and feels generally like a more niche lens.
