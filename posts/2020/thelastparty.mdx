January 19th, 2020. 

I had no idea this would be the last party I would go to for over a year (and counting); the last time I would dance with friends; the last time I would be squeezed indoors with strangers I barely knew; the last time I'd be in public without a mask.

Of course, there is more to life than partying with your friends. But also, in defense of partying: it is fucking great. You don't appreciate it, or any of the other things, until they're gone.

One of the most common covid-discourse questions is whether life will return to "normal" when all of this is done, or whether we'll be permanently changed.

I don't know. The urge to celebrate well into the night, to travel, to be surrounded by strangers and friends, of course these things will persist.

But also, we've picked up all these new habits: we've narrowed our social worlds, adopted a degree of suspicion of others - I think these behaviors will be difficult to unlearn.

I can't wait to try, though.
