This was the first time Covid intersected with my non-online life.

My friends and I stumbled on this protest in Dolores park. A mix of a protest and a memorial, it called attention to Chinese state censorship of early whisteblower [Dr Li Wenliang](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30382-2/fulltext), who sounded the alarm early in Wuhan - only to be met with persecution at the hands of the CCP for "spreading misinformation." He eventually succumbed to Covid.

This memorial gave me chills because it was the first time Covid felt "real". Covid *was* something that existed in the physical world; it went beyond reading tweets about frightening things happening half way around the world in a city I wasn't even aware of a few weeks prior.

(Of course, if you were [following the right people on Twitter](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1222921758375927808), you had been freaked out for about two weeks at this point)

Covid wouldn't officially be classified as a pandemic for another three weeks. But what was clear was that it was coming for us, and the calm before the storm was agonizing.
