This was the first time Covid intersected with my non-online life.

As of Feb 15, Covid hadn't yet arrived on our shores - but it was spreading in Wuhan and beyond, and the world was finally paying attention.

(Of course, if you were [following the right people on Twitter](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1222921758375927808), you had been freaked out for about two weeks at this point)

My friends and I stumbled on this protest in Dolores park. A mix of a protest and a memorial, it called attention to Chinese state censorship of early whisteblower [Dr Li Wenliang](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30382-2/fulltext). Li sounded the alarm early in Wuhan, was persecuted by the CCP for "spreading misinformation". He eventually succumbed to Covid.

This memorial gave me goosebumps at the time. Actually, it still does.
