I would soon be moving from my home in Mission. My roommate left to go quarantine with his family in Portland, and not wanting to risk getting a new roommate in pandemic, it was time to downsize.

It was sad, though. I loved this spot and this neighborhood. It was my first home in San Francisco - my first home after college, in fact - and the first place I'd lived for longer than 9 months in something like 6 years.
