With the moommate hunkering down in Portland with family, it's finally time to leave my Mission apartment of nearly three years.

I loved this spot and this neighborhood. It was my first home in San Francisco - my first home after college, in fact - and the first place I'd lived for longer than nine months in years and years. The first little taste of permanence. The first photo walks.

I'll miss this neighborhood VW bus.

And the Chinese Food & Donuts on the corner (that I never went to).

And 24th street.
