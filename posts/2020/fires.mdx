Ah, 2020.

The year that gave us a raging pandemic, an election which tore at the roots of our democracy, a summer of demonstrations for social justice, two impeachment trials, and riots at the capital. 

Oh right also California caught on fire and blotted out the sun for like two days lol

These shots do not adequately capture how insanely dark it was.

I have a vivid memory of my alarm ringing at 9:30am and being bewildered as to why no light was coming through my windows. I thought it was the middle of the night and almost went back to bed.

I ran outside to capture the terrifying spectacle once I realized what was going on.

And it really was terrifying - or at the very least, deeply unsettling?

It felt like some prehistoric alarm bell in my lizard brain spent all day screaming -

"*YOU CAN'T SEE THE SUN WHICH MEANS THE FOREST IS ON FIRE WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GONNE DIE WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO ESCAPE NOW*"

It was, uh, really hard to get work done.
